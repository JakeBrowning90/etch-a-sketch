# etch-a-sketch

10 Oct 2022 - This is my first version of the Etch-a-Sketch project as part of The Odin Project. It fulfills the basic requirements of the assignment, though I have added a few flourishes of my own. The 12 color options pass their values to a function which changes the class of selected pixel to one with that color. The erase tool works the same way by changing the class back to the default. The Random and Custom options, on the other hand, pass a hex value to the inline style via DOM manipulation. 

I'll continue to work on this for fun and practice. Here are some changes I'd like to implement:

- Restyle layout and fonts for presentability.
- Toggle for grid lines.
- Rework hex code selection to let user choose from palette.
- Select canvas background color.
- Drop menu of different "crayon box" themes. (ie. pastel, neon, holidays, seasons, skin tones, etc)
- Option to save and export drawing.
